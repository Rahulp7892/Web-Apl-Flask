        "# A web service is a software system designed to support machine-to-machine communication over a network (typically the web). Web services enable different applications to communicate with each other by sending and receiving data via standardized protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, REST, or GraphQL.\n",
        "# Web services are typically server-side and are focused on offering data, functionality, or processing capabilities over the web through a well-defined interface (e.g., REST API, SOAP endpoints).

        "# SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are two different approaches for web service communication, each with its own characteristics. Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Protocol vs. Architectural Style\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP is a protocol that defines a set of rules for structuring messages. It requires a specific set of standards, including security, transactions, and messaging patterns (such as reliable messaging). SOAP typically uses XML for message format and relies on other protocols like HTTP, SMTP, or JMS for transport.\n",
        "# REST: REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. It defines a set of principles for designing networked applications, using simple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and focusing on stateless communication. REST can use multiple formats for data, such as JSON, XML, or even plain text, but JSON is the most common.\n",
        "# 2. Message Format\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP messages are always formatted in XML and have a rigid structure with a header and body. This can make the messages heavier and harder to read or parse manually.\n",
        "# REST: REST is more flexible and supports multiple data formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and plain text. JSON is the most widely used format due to its lighter weight and ease of parsing.\n",
        "# 3. Communication and Transport\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP messages are typically sent over HTTP but can also be transmitted using other protocols like SMTP or JMS. SOAP relies on a rigid messaging structure and can work in more complex scenarios requiring formal security (e.g., WS-Security), reliable messaging, or transactions.\n",
        "# REST: REST APIs are typically built around HTTP and use its methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to interact with resources. It operates on a stateless request-response model, where each request contains all the information needed to process it.\n",
        "# 4. Statefulness\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP can be stateful or stateless, depending on the use case. SOAP allows for more complex, stateful interactions (such as handling business transactions).\n",
        "# REST: REST is inherently stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. There is no need for the server to store session information between requests.\n",
        "# 5. Security\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP has built-in security features defined by the WS-Security standard, which allows for encryption, authentication, and message integrity. This makes SOAP suitable for applications that require higher levels of security, such as banking or financial services.\n",
        "# REST: REST relies on underlying transport protocols (usually HTTPS) for security, which provides encryption for data in transit. However, REST doesn’t offer the same robust, built-in security features as SOAP, and the developer typically has to implement security through other means, like OAuth or JWT tokens.\n",
        "# 6. Error Handling\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP uses standard fault elements to handle errors. If a SOAP request fails, a standard error message (formatted in XML) is returned, providing detailed information about the failure.\n",
        "# REST: REST typically uses standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server error) to indicate the status of the response. Error messages in REST can be included in the body of the response, often in JSON format, but error handling is less formal than SOAP.\n",
        "# 7. Performance\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP messages tend to be heavier due to the XML format and the need for additional headers and metadata. This can result in slower performance compared to REST, especially for simple applications.\n",
        "# REST: REST is often faster and more lightweight, especially when using JSON, which is easier to parse than XML. This makes REST well-suited for mobile apps and applications with performance-sensitive requirements.\n",
        "# 8. Use Cases\n",
        "# SOAP: SOAP is better suited for enterprise-level applications that require high security, reliability, and ACID-compliant transactions. It is often used in scenarios like banking systems, payment gateways, and telecommunications.\n",
        "# REST: REST is ideal for web services and cloud-based applications, especially when you need to interact with services in a more flexible and scalable manner. REST is commonly used in mobile apps, social media, and IoT applications.\n",
        "# Summary Table\n",

        "\n",
        "# 1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\n",
        "# Description: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It uses XML as its message format and relies on other protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and more for message negotiation and transmission.\n",
        "# Key Features:\n",
        "# Strict standards and guidelines (e.g., WSDL for service description, WS-Security for encryption and authentication).\n",
        "# Works well in environments requiring high security, transactional integrity, and ACID-compliant operations (e.g., banking, payment systems).\n",
        "# Built-in error handling and messaging features.\n",

        "# Key Features:\n",
        "# Flexible querying: Clients can request just the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.\n",
        "# Single endpoint: Unlike REST, which often requires multiple endpoints, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint.\n",
        "# Strongly typed schema: GraphQL APIs are based on a schema that defines the types and relationships in the API.\n",
        "# Usage: GraphQL is increasingly popular for modern web and mobile applications, particularly where performance and flexibility are a priority (e.g., social media apps, data-heavy platforms).\n",
        "# 3. gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls)\n",
        "# Description: gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the serialization format, and provides features like bidirectional streaming, multiplexing, and built-in authentication.\n",
        "# Key Features:\n",
        "# Efficient binary format (Protocol Buffers) for serialization, leading to smaller payload sizes and faster data exchange compared to JSON.\n",

        "# Role of HTTP Methods in Web API Development\n",
        "# In web API development, HTTP methods (also known as HTTP verbs) play a critical role in defining the actions that can be performed on the resources exposed by the API. These methods are part of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of communication on the web. When building a Web API (especially RESTful APIs), these methods are used to map specific operations (like reading, creating, updating, or deleting data) to corresponding actions on server-side resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Here’s a breakdown of the common HTTP methods and their roles in Web API development:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. GET — Retrieve Data\n",
        "# Purpose: The GET method is used to retrieve data from the server. It should not have any side effects (i.e., it should not modify data).\n",
        "# Role: It is used to read or fetch a resource or a collection of resources from the server.\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# Can be used with query parameters in the URL (e.g., /users?id=123).\n",
        "# It is safe and idempotent, meaning repeated calls should yield the same result.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users.\n",
        "# GET /users/123: Retrieve details of a user with ID 123.\n",
        "# 2. POST — Create Data\n",
        "# Purpose: The POST method is used to send data to the server, typically to create a new resource. It can also be used for operations like submitting forms or initiating a process.\n",
        "# Role: It is used to create new resources on the server or to trigger an action (e.g., logging in or submitting data).\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It is not idempotent, meaning that making the same POST request multiple times could result in different outcomes (e.g., multiple resources being created).\n",
        "# It often includes the data to be created in the body of the request (e.g., user information in a POST request to create a new user).\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# POST /users: Create a new user by sending user details in the request body.\n",
        "# POST /orders: Submit a new order.\n",
        "# 3. PUT — Update Data\n",
        "# Purpose: The PUT method is used to update an existing resource or create a resource if it does not already exist.\n",
        "# Role: It is used to replace the entire resource at a given URL with new data.\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It is idempotent, meaning that making the same PUT request multiple times will result in the same resource state.\n",
        "# Typically used when you want to replace a resource entirely.\n",
        "# Data to be updated is usually sent in the request body.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# PUT /users/123: Replace the user data for the user with ID 123.\n",
        "# PUT /orders/456: Replace the details of order 456.\n",
        "# 4. DELETE — Delete Data\n",
        "# Purpose: The DELETE method is used to remove a resource from the server.\n",
        "# Role: It is used to delete an existing resource identified by the URL.\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It is idempotent, meaning repeated DELETE requests to the same resource should result in the same outcome (i.e., the resource is deleted).\n",
        "# Often, there is no body in the request, but it may have parameters or headers to specify the resource.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# DELETE /users/123: Delete the user with ID 123.\n",
        "# DELETE /orders/456: Delete order 456.\n",
        "# 5. PATCH — Partially Update Data\n",
        "# Purpose: The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource, meaning only specific fields or properties are modified.\n",
        "# Role: It is used when you want to update only part of a resource rather than replacing the entire resource (as you would with PUT).\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It is not idempotent by default, though it can be made idempotent depending on how it’s implemented.\n",
        "# The request body typically contains only the fields to be updated.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# PATCH /users/123: Update only certain fields (e.g., email) of the user with ID 123.\n",
        "# PATCH /orders/456: Update the status of order 456.\n",
        "# 6. HEAD — Retrieve Metadata\n",
        "# Purpose: The HEAD method is used to retrieve metadata about a resource, such as headers, without the actual body of the resource.\n",
        "# Role: It is similar to GET, but it does not return a body. It only returns headers, such as Content-Type, Content-Length, or Last-Modified.\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# Useful for checking if a resource exists or to get metadata like file size or modification time without fetching the entire content.\n",
        "# It is often used to test the availability or check if the resource has changed.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# HEAD /users/123: Get metadata (e.g., headers) for the user with ID 123.\n",
        "# 7. OPTIONS — Retrieve Allowed Methods\n",
        "# Purpose: The OPTIONS method is used to discover which HTTP methods are supported by the server for a specific resource.\n",
        "# Role: It helps clients understand what operations are allowed on a particular resource or endpoint.\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It does not modify any resources.\n",
        "# Often used for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) checks and determining available operations.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# OPTIONS /users: Returns which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are allowed for the /users resource.\n",
        "# 8. TRACE — Debugging\n",
        "# Purpose: The TRACE method is used to echo back the received request so that the client can see what is being sent to the server. It’s mainly used for diagnostic purposes.\n",
        "# Role: It helps in debugging by returning the request as received, including any modifications that might have occurred along the way (e.g., through proxies or firewalls).\n",
        "# Characteristics:\n",
        "# It is rarely used in production APIs due to security concerns.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# TRACE /users/123: Echo back the request to /users/123.\n",
        "# Summary of HTTP Methods:\n",
        "# HTTP Method\tPurpose\tIdempotent?\tUsed For\n",
        "# GET\tRetrieve data\tYes\tRead (fetch) resources\n",
        "# POST\tCreate data\tNo\tCreate a new resource or trigger an action\n",

        "# Purpose of Authentication and Authorization in Web APIs\n",
        "# In the context of Web APIs, authentication and authorization are essential security mechanisms that control access to resources, ensure that only legitimate users can interact with the system, and define what those users are allowed to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Let's break down the two concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Authentication — Verifying Identity\n",
        "# Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In Web APIs, this ensures that the party making the request is who they claim to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Purpose of Authentication:\n",
        "# Establish Trust: Authentication ensures that only legitimate users, systems, or clients can access the API.\n",
        "# Prevent Unauthorized Access: By verifying the identity of users, authentication helps prevent malicious actors from accessing protected resources.\n",
        "# Secure Transactions: Authentication is crucial for ensuring that data is only accessed by authorized users, especially in sensitive or private operations (e.g., banking or healthcare APIs).\n",
        "# Common Authentication Methods in Web APIs:\n",
        "# API Keys: A unique string passed by the client (e.g., in the headers or as a query parameter) to identify and authenticate the requestor.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Authorization: Bearer API_KEY\n",
        "# Basic Authentication: The client sends a username and password encoded in the request header (though this is less secure without HTTPS).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)\n",
        "# OAuth 2.0: A more secure and flexible method that allows users to grant access to their data without exposing their password. It uses access tokens that are generated after the user authenticates with an identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN\n",
        "# JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A widely used token-based authentication method that securely transmits user information between the client and server. JWT tokens are self-contained and can be validated by the server without needing to look up session data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN\n",
        "# OAuth 1.0a: An earlier version of OAuth that is less common today, but still used in certain systems (e.g., Twitter's API).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Session Cookies: In traditional web applications, authentication may be managed through session cookies stored in the browser and sent with each request.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Authentication Workflow:\n",
        "# User Login: The user provides their credentials (e.g., username/password, third-party login) to the API.\n",
        "# Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the server generates an authentication token (e.g., JWT, API Key) and sends it to the client.\n",
        "# Token Usage: The client includes the token in subsequent API requests to prove their identity.\n",
        "# Token Validation: The API server validates the token for each incoming request and grants access if valid.\n",
        "# 2. Authorization — Granting Access to Resources\n",
        "# Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access or modify. While authentication identifies the user, authorization defines what they are allowed to do after they’ve been authenticated.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Purpose of Authorization:\n",
        "# Access Control: Authorization ensures that authenticated users can only access resources that they have permission to use.\n",
        "# Protect Sensitive Data: It helps to restrict access to confidential information and actions that could affect the system or other users.\n",
        "# Granular Permissions: Authorization allows fine-grained control over what different users or user roles can do within an application.\n",
        "# Common Authorization Techniques:\n",
        "# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The user is assigned to one or more roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator) and each role has specific permissions that define what actions it can perform (e.g., read, write, delete).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: An Admin can create or delete users, while a User can only view their profile.\n",
        "# Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Access is granted based on attributes (e.g., user attributes like \"department\" or \"location,\" resource attributes, and the environment). ABAC is more flexible than RBAC and allows for complex rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: A manager can access data about their team members, but not others, based on attributes like job title or department.\n",
        "# Access Control Lists (ACLs): A list of permissions attached to resources that specifies who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: A document may have an ACL specifying that only certain users or groups can edit or view it.\n",
        "# OAuth 2.0 Scopes: In OAuth 2.0, access tokens can be granted with specific scopes, which define the level of access or permission a user has to different parts of an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: A token might allow the user to access \"read\" data but not \"write\" data (e.g., read:user, write:orders).\n",
        "# Fine-Grained Permissions: Some APIs allow specific actions like \"read\", \"write\", \"delete\", or \"update\" for each resource type, and those permissions are defined at the user or resource level.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: A user might have permission to update their own profile, but not to update other users' profiles.\n",
        "# Authentication vs. Authorization\n",
        "# Authentication\tAuthorization\n",
        "# Verifies who the user is.\tDetermines what the user can do.\n",
        "# Involves verifying credentials (e.g., username, password, tokens).\tInvolves granting or denying access to resources or actions.\n",
        "# Example: Login with username/password, or via OAuth.\tExample: User can view their profile, but cannot delete records.\n",
        "# Ensures identity is confirmed.\tEnsures users only have the permissions they need.\n",
        "# Real-World Example: Online Banking API\n",
        "# Authentication: A user logs in to an online banking system using their username and password. Once their credentials are verified, the server issues a token (such as a JWT) that proves the user’s identity for future requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Authorization: After logging in, the user is authorized to perform specific actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "# Admin users can view and edit all accounts.\n",
        "# Regular users can only view and manage their own account and perform transactions like fund transfers.\n",
        "# Authorization rules determine what data (e.g., account balance, transaction history) the user can access and what operations (e.g., transfer, withdrawal) they can perform."

        "# The server does not retain information about client sessions or store any state regarding previous interactions.\n",

        "# Improved Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "# Statelessness enables horizontal scaling because any server can handle any request, and there’s no need to keep track of clients.\n",

        "# Reliability and Fault Tolerance\n",
        "\n",
        "# Since there’s no dependency on stored state, servers can recover from failures without losing session information.\n",

        "# Caching\n",

        "# Statelessness supports caching, as each request is independent. Responses can be cached without concerns about session-dependent variations, which can improve performance and reduce server load.\n",
        "# How Statelessness is Achieved in RESTful APIs\n",
        "# Authentication with Tokens: Clients send an access token (e.g., JWT) or API key with each request. The server verifies the token with each interaction to authenticate and authorize the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Explicit Data in Requests: Clients include all required data in each request (e.g., query parameters, request body) rather than relying on stored state.\n",
        "\n",
        "# State Managed on the Client: Any necessary state, like session information, must be stored client-side. For example, if a client needs to remember a user’s session, it can store the token locally and send it with each request.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example of a Stateless Interaction\n",
        "# Request: A client requests data by sending GET /api/v1/products/123 with an authorization token in the headers.\n",

        "# REST (Representational State Transfer) is a widely adopted architectural style for building APIs, offering several advantages over alternative approaches like SOAP, RPC, or GraphQL, depending on the context. Below are the key benefits of RESTful APIs:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Simplicity\n",
        "# Ease of Understanding: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and conventions, making them easy to understand for developers familiar with web technologies.\n",
        "# Minimal Overhead: REST avoids additional layers of complexity (e.g., XML-based messaging in SOAP), using lightweight formats like JSON and plain URLs.\n",
        "# 2. Statelessness\n",
        "# Scalability: REST's stateless nature means each request from a client contains all the information needed for processing. This simplifies server design and allows horizontal scaling.\n",
        "# Independent Requests: Clients and servers do not need to maintain session state, reducing memory usage and simplifying server implementation.\n",
        "# 3. Flexibility\n",
        "# Language Agnostic: REST APIs can be consumed by any client that can make HTTP requests, regardless of programming language or platform.\n",
        "# Wide Client Compatibility: REST works well with web browsers, mobile devices, IoT devices, and more, as HTTP is universally supported.\n",
        "# 4. Resource-Oriented Design\n",
        "# Structured Access: REST emphasizes resource-oriented design, where resources (e.g., users, orders, products) are identified by URLs and manipulated through standard HTTP methods.\n",
        "# Clear Semantics: This design approach leads to predictable and meaningful interaction patterns.\n",
        "# 5. Caching\n",
        "# Performance Optimization: REST supports HTTP caching mechanisms, reducing server load and improving response times by allowing repeated requests to use cached data.\n",
        "# 6. Interoperability\n",
        "# Standards-Based: REST builds on existing web standards such as HTTP, URLs, and media types, ensuring broad interoperability across systems.\n",
        "# Ecosystem Support: REST APIs integrate seamlessly with web infrastructure, including proxies, firewalls, and web browsers.\n",
        "# 7. Discoverability\n",
        "# Dynamic Interactions: REST APIs, especially with HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State), allow clients to navigate and interact dynamically by discovering available actions and resources through hypermedia.\n",
        "# 8. Stateless Testing and Debugging\n",
        "# Simplified Testing: Since REST requests are stateless and self-contained, debugging and testing are straightforward using tools like Postman, cURL, or browser-based debuggers.\n",
        "# 9. Widespread Adoption\n",
        "# Community Support: REST has a large community, mature tools, and extensive documentation, making it easier for developers to adopt and troubleshoot.\n",
        "# Industry Standards: Many third-party services, libraries, and frameworks are REST-compliant, providing ready-to-use solutions.\n",
        "# 10. Cost-Effectiveness\n",
        "# Lower Development Cost: REST APIs are easier to develop, deploy, and maintain, reducing time-to-market and overall cost.\n",
        "# Reuse of Existing Web Technology: REST leverages existing web infrastructure, reducing the need for specialized middleware or additional tooling.\n",

        "# Feature\tREST\tSOAP\tGraphQL\tRPC\n",
        "# Complexity\tSimple and lightweight\tHeavy (XML, WS-* protocols)\tMedium (custom queries)\tSimple but tightly coupled\n",

        "# REST (Representational State Transfer) handles communication between clients and servers by following a set of architectural principles designed for simplicity, scalability, and stateless interactions. Here’s an overview of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Stateless Communication\n",
        "# REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
        "# The server does not store any client-specific context between requests. This simplifies server design and improves scalability.\n",
        "# 2. Resource-Based\n",
        "# REST revolves around resources, which are identified using unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).\n",
        "# Clients interact with these resources by sending requests to the server, typically over HTTP.\n",
        "# 3. HTTP Methods\n",
        "# REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:\n",
        "# GET: Retrieve a resource.\n",
        "# POST: Create a new resource.\n",
        "# PUT: Update an existing resource.\n",
        "# DELETE: Remove a resource.\n",
        "# These methods ensure clarity in operations and adhere to REST principles.\n",
        "# 4. Representation of Resources\n",
        "# Resources are represented in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or HTML.\n",
        "# The client specifies its preferred representation using HTTP headers (e.g., Accept: application/json).\n",
        "# 5. Stateless Server-Side Logic\n",
        "# Because REST is stateless, the server does not maintain sessions for clients.\n",
        "# Authentication is often handled using tokens or API keys passed with each request (e.g., in headers or query parameters).\n",
        "# 6. Client-Server Separation\n",
        "# REST enforces a clear separation between the client and server:\n",
        "# Client: Responsible for the user interface and initiating requests.\n",
        "# Server: Handles resource storage, processing, and response generation.\n",
        "# This separation allows independent development and scaling of both sides.\n",
        "# 7. Cacheability\n",
        "# REST encourages responses to be explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable using HTTP headers like Cache-Control.\n",
        "# Caching improves performance by reducing the need for repeated requests.\n",
        "# 8. Layered System\n",
        "# REST allows for intermediate servers, such as load balancers, caches, or proxies, to handle requests and improve scalability and security.\n",
        "# Clients do not need to know if they are communicating with the end server or an intermediary.\n",
        "# Example Workflow\n",
        "# Client Request: The client sends an HTTP GET request to https://api.example.com/users/123 to fetch a user resource.\n",

        "\n",
        "# 1. Use Standard HTTP Status Codes\n",
        "# Use HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error. This leverages the standardized semantics of the HTTP protocol.\n",
        "# Categories of Status Codes:\n",
        "# 4xx (Client Errors): Issues caused by the client.\n",
        "# 400 Bad Request: The request contains invalid syntax or parameters.\n",
        "# 401 Unauthorized: Authentication credentials are missing or invalid.\n",
        "# 403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource.\n",
        "# 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.\n",
        "# 429 Too Many Requests: The client has exceeded the rate limit.\n",
        "# 5xx (Server Errors): Issues caused by the server.\n",
        "# 500 Internal Server Error: A generic server-side error.\n",
        "# 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unavailable.\n",
        "# Best Practice: Avoid custom status codes and stick to standard ones for interoperability.\n",
        "# 2. Provide Descriptive Error Messages\n",
        "# Include meaningful, human-readable messages in the error response body.\n",
        "# Example:\n",
        "# json\n",
        "# Copy code\n",
        "# {\n",
        "#   \"error\": \"Invalid Input\",\n",
        "#   \"message\": \"The 'email' field is required.\",\n",
        "#   \"code\": 400\n",
        "# }\n",
        "# 3. Use Consistent Error Structures\n",
        "# Design a uniform error response format across all endpoints.\n",
        "# Recommended Format:\n",
        "# json\n",
        "# Copy code\n",
